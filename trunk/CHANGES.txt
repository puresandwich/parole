    The display is essentially a scenegraph of shaders. A shader is a collection
    of shaders, update functions, and a draw method. A pass is a shader with a 
    concrete draw method, whereas a plain shader just draws all the shaders 
    contained in it. Shaders have various properties - pos, size, alpha. Passes 
    can have additional properties depending on the nature of the pass.
