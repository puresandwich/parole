0.1.0 Completed on: 2/26/06
----------------------------------------------------

--=== Todo for 0.2.0 ===--

Bugs:
[ ] Needs more documentation.

Features:
[x] Display module
[x] Display properties controled by config system
[x] Flip display in game loop
[x] FPS calculation
[x] Resource management
[x] Shaders!
    The display is essentially a scenegraph of shaders. A shader is a collection
    of shaders, update functions, and a draw method. A pass is a shader with a 
    concrete draw method, whereas a plain shader just draws all the shaders 
    contained in it. Shaders have various properties - pos, size, alpha. Passes 
    can have additional properties depending on the nature of the pass.
[x] Some built-in shaders, passes, blendfuncs, update functions
    [x] ColorField
    [x] Texture
[x] Unit testing layout
[x] Readme, setup.y, changelog, etc. New distribution layout.

Test App:
Some sort of simple toy game controlled by keyboard.

0.4.0 Completed on: 5/11/08
----------------------------------------------------

--=== Todo for 0.5.0 ===--
This version fleshes out maps. Utility functions for map generation, field of
view calculations, lighting, saving/loading, and on-screen message placement.

Bugs:
[.] More documentation.
[x] ScrollView needs to be sped up a bit for largish maps
    - ScrollView is now significantly faster in cases where it has only one
      pass (which is normal for maps, text, etc.).
[x] FOV has some performance problems, especially when remembering tiles. The
    more tiles have been seen, the slower it gets to update FOV even in unrelated
    parts of the map. Maybe ShaderGrid needs optimizing? Fixed - it was a
    problem with nondirty passes being added to Shader.dirtyPasses through
    addPass(), but then never having a chance to get removed, because they
    weren't internally dirty, so never got updated/cleaned.
[x] Why does importing PyGame now cause malloc errors?
    - answer: using bad verison of stackless. screw stackless.
[x] Update copyrights.
[x] LightSource instancemethod distmons broke map saving.

Features:
[x] Option to make map font square.
[x] Map creation (Generators)
[x]     MapObjectGenerator
[x]     TemplateGenerator - v1. Just apply generators in legend to individual
            tiles; no area generators, no scaling/tiling
[x]     Template Generator - v2. Tiling.
[x]     Cellular Automata Generator
[x]     Perlin noise generator
[x] Map state saving/loading
[x]     Pickling shaders (without pickling Surfaces)
[x] FOV
[x]     Integrate MacDonald's code; Map2D.filedOfView wrapper
[x]     Selective quadrant FOV
[x]     Circular FOV
[x]     Binding a MapFrame to a MapObject's field of view
[x]     Ability for MapFrame to "remember" seen but no longer visible tiles
[x]     Be selective about quadrants updated for MapFrame FOV
[x] Tile highlighting and selecting
[x] LOS - testing and tracing
[x] MapFrame message display/annotation system
[x]     Annotation Basics
[x]     Simple customization of annotation appearance
[x]     Annotations of tiles offscreen (should be better)
[x]     Overlays should show up on remembered but unseen tiles.
[x]     Handle overlays on unseen, unremembered tiles.
[x] Lighting and LightSources
[x]     Basics

    [ ] Make it easy to package a game for distribution.

0.5.0 Completed on:
----------------------------------------------------

--=== Todo for 0.6.0 ===--
This version introduces the sim module, which provides all the components of a
discrete-event agent based simulation system (powered by SimPy?), along with
various utilities specifically useful for roguelike games.

Bugs:
[ ] There are probably still some shaders that aren't picklable.
[ ] Remebered tiles don't quite work right, can reveal changes out of FOV.
    Need to work out better separation of overlay display from tile content
    display. 

Features:
[ ] Agents and Events; SimPy integration?
[ ] Saving/loading simulation state. generators a problem?
[ ] Pathfinding
[ ] More map creation
[ ]     Template Generator - v3. Scaling.
[ ]     Template Generator - v4. Area effects (including recursive).
